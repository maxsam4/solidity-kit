# solidity-kit
Basic docker images with tools for solidity development and CI.

Currently, there is only a single tag `latest` that contains Ubuntu bionic + node 8 + yarn + npm + solc 0.5 (native) + truffle 5.

The builds are hosted on docker hub and can be fetched directly from the repo `maxsam4/solidity-kit`.

To pull the docker image:
```
docker pull maxsam4/solidity-kit
```
